Our research has shown that the confidence level of enterprise customers in the cloud would increase dramatically if they had (1) customer controlled encryption, (2) attribute based access control, (3) tamper evident logs (ledgers), and (4) the ability to configure and enforce these controls via a central policy system across multiple data engines. \n\nThis session provides an overview of how we are combining the power of Azure Information Protection for Bring Your Own Key and Access Control policies with strong security assurances of Always Encrypted (AE) in Azure SQL Database, together for the first two data engines: Azure SQL Database Managed Instance and Azure Stream Analytics. We demonstrate how it can be used to secure sensitive data on premises, during migration, and while in use in Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.",

            "description": "From smart sensors and actuating devices to integrated robotic systems, industrial organizations are employing increasingly sophisticated automation technologies to drive efficiency and productivity. As a result, a new class of systems are evolving to go beyond basic automation. Instead of performing specific tasks repeatedly without variation, these autonomous systems sense and dynamically respond to changing environments to accomplish a desired goal. Autonomous systems are capable of not only routine, process-driven tasks, but also deliver increasingly optimized results while freeing up human capital to operate at a higher strategic level.\n \nTo get the most value from autonomous systems, businesses will need to take an integrated, cross-functional approach. This means leveraging existing expertise by engaging their domain experts to help build and manage these systems, not just data scientists and software developers. And, it means creating secure and compliant systems that are also transparent, explainable, and open so that they can work effectively with a broader ecosystem. All of this requires a platform designed for integration, evolution, and scale.\n \nMicrosoft offers a trusted, enterprise-grade platform for creating autonomous systems that build on unique organizational domain expertise. Our comprehensive portfolio of tools and services enables organizations and their employees to develop, manage, and optimize autonomous systems across the full lifecycle. Our vision is to empower humans to achieve more by accelerating the journey from automated to autonomous systems.\n \nIn this session, learn about this platform and the techniques that enable building this new class of powerful solutions.",

The latest speech recognition models from Azure Cognitive Services excel at transcribing this telephony data, even in cases when the data is difficult for a human to understand. Telephony data can be used to better understand your customers' needs, identify new marketing opportunities, or evaluate the performance of call center agents.

Nobody wants a cloud migration strategy that looks like running and managing a bunch of file server VMs in the cloud and other cloud vendors have totally different services for SMB and NFS. With Azure Files, you get simple, secure, and serverless file shares that you can mount directly with SMB, cache locally on premises with Azure File Sync, and at Microsoft Ignite 2019, we are extremely excited to add NFS 4.1 (preview) support as well. Azure Files makes cloud migrations a breeze by providing consistent administrator experience for all of your cloud file shares!\n\nThis session provides a deep-dive on how you can use the new features of Azure Files to migrate general purpose file shares, lift and shift existing line-of-business applications, and build modern container-based applications. In addition to covering NFS 4.1, we discuss our new lower-cost file share tiers, how you can domain join an Azure file share to your on-premises AD domain, previous versions integration for Azure File Sync, and more!",

One common drone scenario is for remote inspection. In inspection scenarios, drones are typically flown manually around the site or object to be inspected gathering video and images for human review at a later date.  Drones are increasingly moving from manual operations to more autonomous operations and missions. Microsoft’s autonomous systems platform enables you to build increased autonomy into your drone solutions. Using Dronecode and the autonomous systems platform, learn how to architect an autonomous inspection drone. Microsoft joined the Dronecode project, which promotes an end-to-end open source stack for building autonomous drones. The Dronecode platform includes PX4 for flight control, QGroundControl for ground control, AirSim for simulation, and the Robot Operating System (ROS) for programming.\n\nIn this talk, we introduce you to the architecture for building your own autonomous drones using Dronecode and the autonomous systems platform. Learn about the end-to-end stack and how to develop using simulation and then move to actual hardware for testing.",

That's why the deployment slots feature of Azure App Services is such a nice experience. With deployment slots, you can deploy to a safe slot in the same conditions as your production environment. You can test in isolation, without risking breaking something. Then you can gradually route some of the traffic to the new features, for example to perform A/B testing. When you are satisfied with the results, you can simply switch the whole traffic to the new site. But don't fret, if something goes wrong, the old, safe site is just one mouse click away.",

This includes App Center (for building and distributing Kotlin, Swift, and React Native apps), and infrastructure-as-code with Azure Pipelines and ARM to automate our infra and app deployments.\n\nWe also explain how Azure DevOps has had a positive effect on our working environment, boosting team confidence, and why we feel it is the ideal platform for us moving forward.",

We next show you how to use the familiar SSDT/SSMS tools to design/test/deploy/execute your SSIS packages in the cloud just like you do on premises. Finally, we show you how to modernize your ETL workflows by invoking/scheduling SSIS package executions as first-class activities in ADF pipelines and combining/chaining them with other activities, allowing you to trigger your pipeline runs by events, automatically (de)provision SSIS IR just in time, etc.",

He uses the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit with its Q# language and simulator to demonstrate concepts and show that even though scalable quantum computers are several years away, quantum-inspired algorithms are solving problems more efficiently today.",
